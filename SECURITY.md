# Security Policy

Delphix takes security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciates the security research community’s efforts in responsible disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately.

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues or forum posts for suspected vulnerabilities. This allows us to assess and address the vulnerability before it becomes public knowledge.

### How to Report

Please email the details of the vulnerability to: **[security@perforce.com](mailto:security@delphix.com)**.

### What to Include

To help us triage and resolve the issue quickly, please include:
* The specific project and version affected.
* A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
* Steps to reproduce the issue (or a Proof of Concept script).
* Any relevant logs or configuration details.

## Response Timeline

* **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **two (2) business days**.
* **Resolution:** While security fixes will be prioritized above other development work, Delphix does not guarantee specific resolution timeframes as the complexity of security issues varies significantly 
## Disclosure Policy

Delphix requests that security researchers follow responsible disclosure practices:

* Provide reasonable time for us to investigate and resolve the issue before making any public disclosure.
* Refrain from accessing or modifying data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* Avoid actions that could degrade Delphix services or harm our users (e.g., DoS attacks, spamming).
